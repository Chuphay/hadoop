    "In 2003, Ghemawat and Dean wrote a program to greatly simplify the use of parallel and distributed systems, which they have outlined in their [paper.](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf) Their program was able to take care of the details of partioning the data over numerous computers, scheduling which programs ran at which time and on which machine, managing the necessary between computer communication, and managing what happens when an error occurs. Their program allows everyday programmers to use vast clusters of commodity machines without any particular experience using parallel or distributed systems. "
