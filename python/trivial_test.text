Take Salesforce for example. Right now it just presents data, and the human user has to draw her or his predictive insights in their heads. Yet most of us have been trained by Google, which uses information from millions of variables based on ours and others’ usage to tailor our user experience … why shouldn’t we expect the same here? Enterprise applications — in every use case imaginable — should and will become inherently more intelligent as the machine implicitly learns patterns in the data and derives insights. It will be like having an intelligent, experienced human assistant in everything we do.

The key here is in more automated apps where big data drives what the application does, and with no user intervention. (My colleague Frank Chen calls this the “big data inside” architecture for apps).
